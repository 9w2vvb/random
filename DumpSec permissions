# DumpSec permissions (hex)
# -------------------------
# Notes: when you see hex codes, it means that the permission are note the "standard" ones, but a combination that can't be listed with 
# the simple RWXD value. you can check the folder for the permission conbination that's actually configured.
# DumpSec can't readily be fixed for this, as it was designed in a time when security settings were more simple, like read, write, execute, 
# and delete. With the new security settings added on Windows 2000, DumpSec doesn't know how to report them.
# The codes of ax00000002 and ax00000004 are most likely caused by the propagation information that applies to those specific permissions. 
# ax00000002 generally indicates a container inheritance ACE while ax00000004 generally indicates a non-propagated inheritance ACE.
# DumpSec was designed before the addition of the new inheritance features and these changes make its way of reporting security difficult 
# to apply.
