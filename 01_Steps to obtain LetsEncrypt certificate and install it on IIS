00 - Steps to acquire SSL cert from LetsEncrypt and install on IIS

1. Install Git and bc
      $ sudo apt-get -y install git bc

2. Clone LetsEncrypt repository from GitHub
      $ sudo git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt /opt/letsencrypt
	--- you should now have a copy of the LetsEncrypt repository in /opt/letsencrypt directory

3. Obtain a Certificate from LetsEncrypt
	--- stop any webserver e.g nginx or apache from using port 80 by checking the active port running on the server
      $ sudo netstat -na | grep ':80.*LISTEN'
	--- if there is no output when you run this command, you can use the standalone plugin.

4. Run Let's Encrypt client
      $ cd /opt/letsencrypt
	  $ sudo ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone
	--- at the prompt, enter an email address that will be used for notices and lost key recovery
	--- e.g webmaster@mydomain.com
	--- click Agree on Term of Services
	--- enter your domain name
	--- e.g mydomain.com sub.mydomain.com www.mydomain.com
        --- if everything is successful, you should see an output message that congratulate you on certificate issuance
	--- LetsEncrypt will validate that A record is created for the domain, if it failed you need to fix the record in your domain manager e.g Godaddy etc

5. Check the certificate files
	--- after obtaining the cert, you will have the following PEM-encoded files:
	--- cert.pem: Your domain's certificate 			/* for easy identification, rename it to mydomain.com.pem */
	--- chain.pem: The Let's Encrypt chain certificate 	/* for easy identification, rename it to mydomain.com.chain.pem */
	--- fullchain.pem: cert.pem and chain.pem combined	/* for easy identification, rename it to mydomain.com.fullchain.pem */
	--- privkey.pem: Your certificate's private key		/* for easy identification, rename it to mydomain.com.key */
        --- these files are located in /etc/letsencrypt/archive with symbolic link created at /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain_name

6. Convert the PEM files to IIS format (.pfx)
	  $ sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -out mydomain.com.pfx -inkey mydomain.com.key -in mydomain.com.pem -certfile mydomain.com.fullchain.pem
	--- enter password as required
        --- check the current directory, there is now mydomain.com.pfx created
	--- you can use the .pfx file to import it in certmgr.msc and bind it in IIS
