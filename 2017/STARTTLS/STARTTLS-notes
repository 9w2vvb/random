STARTTLS is an opportunistic encryption system, which encrypts communications between email servers that use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) standard.
When a user emails someone on a different provider (say, a Hotmail user writing to a Gmail user), the mail message will have to be delivered over the Internet.
If both email servers understand STARTTLS, then the communications will be encrypted in transit. 
If only Gmail does but Hotmail does not (the current situation), they will be in the clear and exposed to eavesdropping, 
so itâ€™s critical to get as many email service providers as possible to implement the system.
