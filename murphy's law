# Murphy's Law(s)
#
anything that can go wrong, will go wrong

if anything simply cannot go wrong, it will anyway

nothing is as easy as it looks

if everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something

everything takes longer than you think

if there is a possibilities of several things going wrong, the one that will cause most damage will be the one to go wrong

if you try to please everybody, nobody will like it

a shortcut is a longest distance between two points

friends come and go, but enemies accumulate

in order to get a loan, you must first prove you don't need it

anything you try to fix will take longer and cost more than you thought

if it jams, force it. if it breaks, it needed replacing anyway

if you fool around with a thing for very long you will screw it up

no matter how long or hard you shop for an item, after you've bought it, it will be on sale somewhere cheaper

you will always find something in the last place you look

the other line always moves faster

build a system that even a fool can use and only a fool will use it

it is impossible to make anything foolproof, because fools are so ingenious

if it seems too good to be true, it probably is

left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse

whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first

every solution breeds new problema

a bird in the hand is better than one overhead

anything good in life is either illegal, immoral or fattening

if more than one person is responsible for a miscalculation, no one will be at fault

beauty is only skin deep, ugly goes to the bone

in case of doubt, make it sound convincing

there's never time to do it right, but there's always time to do it over

smile, tomorrow could (will) be worse
