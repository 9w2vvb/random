# Steps to Import LetsEncrypt PEM certificate into NetScaler
# work in progress

# check if web server is running on Port 80; and stop it
#
# $ sudo netstat -na | grep ':80.*LISTEN'
# $ service nginx status
# $ service nginx stop

# run LetsEncrypt agent
#
# $ cd /opt/letsencrypt
# $ sudo ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone

# check certificate file is successfully created under /etc/letsencrypt/archive
# with symbolic link created at /etc/letsencrypt/live/

# NetScaler support PEM certificate format
# there is no need to convert the PEM cert to another format to import it to NetScaler
#
# We only need to remove the passphrase from an existing OpenSSL key file
# refer http://www.microhowto.info/howto/remove_the_passphrase_from_an_existing_openssl_key_file.html

# Steps
# to remove passphrase from key file:
# $ openssl rsa -in /location/of/certificate_key.pem -out /location/of/certificate.key

# then on NetScaler, go to Configuration \ Traffic Management \ SSL \ Certificates \ Install
# install the certificate chain first with the following value (example):
# Certificate-Key Pair Name*: domain.com.chain
# Certificate File Name*: chain1.pem
# Certificate Format: PEM
# Password: <leave blank>
# and click Install

# follow the same steps as above to install domain.com certificate
# sample value:
# Certificate-Key Pair Name*: domain.com
# Certificate File Name*: cert1.pem
# Key File Name: certificate.key
# Certificate Format: PEM
# Password: <leave blank>
# and click Install

# once domain.com certificate is installed, right-click on it and link to domain.com.chain

# Fin
